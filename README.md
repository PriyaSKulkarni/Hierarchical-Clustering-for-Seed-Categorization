# Hierarchical-Clustering-for-Seed-Categorization
CSE-6363-001-MACHINE LEARNING: Final Project: Clustering on the UCI seed dataset to divide it in groups and use the cluser IDs as labels for a subsequent K nearest neighbor classifier to identify the species. Technologies used: Python, Machine Learning Algorithms, Data Science, Jupyter Notebook

Problem Statement: Implement Hierarchical Clustering on the UCI seed dataset to divide it in groups and use the cluser IDs as labels for a subsequent K nearest neighbor classifier to identify the species. You should use multiple clusterings here and have to determine what a good number of clusters would be and how to determine the similarity between clusters and a data point.
